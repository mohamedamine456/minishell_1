-list functions for pipes (new, last, addback, addfront, size, clear) ==> {{{done}}}
-check (addback for command_list)	==> {{{done}}}
-free all allocation	==> still have some leaks
-finish spliting commands by the end of the week ==> have to work on redirections

-don't forget to see the is_option function ==> Worked with echo

-check debugger problem of allocation memory for name in the command struct (prob below) when there is a ; at the end check it as soon as possible:
				["error: Couldn't apply expression side effects : Couldn't dematerialize a result variable: couldn't read its memory"] ==> {{{Fixed (done)}}}

- check leaks on pipe ==> still have some leaks
- 06/03/2021
	- tomorrow work on directions and finish some unfinished work and functions
	- check with multiple example to see if there is a segfault or not: check it every day
	- an empty command (should fix that): {{{Fixed}}}



- after spliting with ';' and spliting with '|' each part would be split by '>' , '<' or '>>' from put_elements_command function

- look at allocation_function you can combin 2 functions to 1

instead of splitting by redirections think the best way is to trim the redirections

- 08/03/2021
- keep working on the redirections
- test next_space function
- use it to split words
- finish parsing before thursday
