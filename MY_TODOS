-list functions for pipes (new, last, addback, addfront, size, clear) ==> {{{done}}}
-check (addback for command_list)	==> {{{done}}}
-free all allocation	==> still have some leaks
-finish spliting commands by the end of the week ==> have to work on redirections

-don't forget to see the is_option function ==> Worked with echo

-check debugger problem of allocation memory for name in the command struct (prob below) when there is a ; at the end check it as soon as possible:
				["error: Couldn't apply expression side effects : Couldn't dematerialize a result variable: couldn't read its memory"] ==> {{{Fixed (done)}}}

- check leaks on pipe ==> still have some leaks
- 06/03/2021
	- tomorrow work on directions and finish some unfinished work and functions
	- check with multiple example to see if there is a segfault or not: check it every day
	- an empty command (should fix that): {{{Fixed}}}



- after spliting with ';' and spliting with '|' each part would be split by '>' , '<' or '>>' from put_elements_command function

- look at allocation_function you can combin 2 functions to 1

instead of splitting by redirections think the best way is to trim the redirections

- 08/03/2021
- keep working on the redirections
- test next_space function: {{Fixed}}
- use it to split words
- finish parsing before thursday: On Worked

- remove redirections from command after putting them in the struct

09/03/2021: --------------
- write remove spaces function the one you writed not working

11-03-2021:
- i ll put redirections into pipes and clean all parts of command from spaces...
- split args with another function wich depend on {"} {'} and space
- i should fix the leaks


segfault in this part : echo atr | tr -d a | > allo ===> {F*** Fixed}
- leaks to fix ===> {{FIXED}} 14/03

- still have prob with this :  echo "14 + 19" > a > b > c|bc < a < b < c > e> f  > file --> {{Fixed}}

and this too :  echo \ + 5 ==> {{Fixed}}

- find a better way to check on option from args : 
- write function that sort option and a args :
- replace env variables 
-----------------------------
- write a function to clean all args and cmd->name from backslashes and quotes ==> {{Fixed but need tests from someone}}
- use dispatch tables to clean ==> {{On Load}}
- finish this monday



- work on dollar sign 
- work on option write function that check if it is an option or not
